                            <p>Something I really enjoy about this place is that the instructors are extremely friendly and interactive! The environment is very welcoming and the instructors make sure everyone has a wonderful experience at the dojo. They adapt the private lessons to fit your needs and pace, and the group lessons are always a fun and uplifting experience!

                                You don‚Äôt need to already have experience in martial arts to come here. People of any experience can come and always learn something new. I highly recommend Strange SD to anyone who is interested in learning martial arts along with learning other essential life skills as well.</p>

                            <p>I went to the women's self defense class last week and it was so good! They had lots of female instructors and they made it such a comfortable and welcoming environment. For each of the techniques they taught, they split us into small groups so we got lots of individual practice and immediate feedback/tips from the instructors. They also gave great tips on preparing mentally which was awesome!</p>

                            <p>I attended the women‚Äôs self defense class here recently and it was a blast! The instructors were friendly and gave practical tips that were skill-level appropriate. I learned lots of useful tips for self defense that I genuinely feel I could use in a real life situation! Excited for the next one üéâ</p>

                        <p>This dojo has got to be one of the best dojo‚Äôs I have ever been in. They physically and mentally prepare you for any unknown dangers. This place genuinely helps me with my health, self confidence, and self defense. The main purpose of this dojo is to help people have a better mindset and physical and mentally train your self to surpass your limits in being a warrior. I have never felt better after joining this dojo and I‚Äôm proud to be in a dojo like this and I recommend more people to join as well!</p>
